# üé¨ Simple Movie Recommendation System (No CSV Required)

This is a simple **content-based movie recommender system** built using **Python**, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`. It suggests similar movies based on **genre similarity** using **cosine similarity**, without the need for any external datasets (no CSV files required).

## üìå Features

- Recommends top similar movies based on genre.
- Uses `CountVectorizer` and `cosine_similarity` from scikit-learn.
- Movie dataset is defined directly in the Python code.
- Lightweight, clean, and easy to understand.
- Perfect for learning recommendation system fundamentals.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Install Required Packages** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
2.  Save the script as movie_recommender.py.
3.  Run the script:
    python movie_recommender.py
4. You‚Äôll see movie recommendations printed in the terminal for predefined titles.


üß† How It Works

1.A small movie dataset (title + genres) is manually created in a list.

2.The genres are converted into vectors using CountVectorizer.

3.Cosine similarity measures how close each movie is to the input.

4.The function recommend(movie_title) prints the top 5 most similar movies.
